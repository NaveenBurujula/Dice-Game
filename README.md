The Dice Game project is an interactive web-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game simulates the rolling of two dice, where players take turns to roll and score points based on the outcome. The first player to reach a specified score wins the game. The user interface is designed with CSS for a visually appealing experience, and JavaScript handles the game logic, including dice rolls, score updates, and turn management. This project provides an engaging way to learn and demonstrate fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation and event handling.
